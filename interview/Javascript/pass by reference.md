# pass by reference

Javascript是一门pass-by-value的语言,对象等变量进行赋值的时候,传递的是值(引用),而不是引用.

When you pass a reference to a mutable object, you're passing a value — the reference to the object. You can't write "swap" in JavaScript.

[JavaScript does not have "pass by reference"](http://whatsthepointy.blogspot.com/2013/11/javascript-does-not-have-pass-by.html)
